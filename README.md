Repository for my entry in the 10k Apart contest 
The only file needed to run the demo is index.html. No dependencies.

To build, just clone and ```npm install```

To compile the source: ```gulp || gulp watch```

This project is a CSS only demo. Just html and loads of SCSS magix. 

If you have any question just drop a line, or smoke sign or email, letterâ€¦ whatever.
